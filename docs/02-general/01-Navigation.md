Mapping Tools by default opens to the Get Started Screen, which contains a changelog of the application, as well as a list of most recently used maps with Mapping Tools. This screen can also be reached via the navigation menu.

At the top of the screen is a blue bar which holds the navigation toggle button, menus, and display for the _Current beatmap_. This is the beatmap that will be worked on by most of the mapping tools.

The navigation toggle button opens a menu on the left which you use to navigate to all pages in Mapping Tools. There is a search bar in which you can type the name of the page and you can press `Enter` to navigate to the top result. At all times, you can use `Ctrl+K` to open the navigation menu.

:::caution Under Construction

These docs are incomplete.

:::

Thank you for your interest in helping with the Mapping Tools website!

The Mapping Tools website is currently looking for assistance with translating documentation. If you're willing to help out, it would be greatly appreciated!

We're currently focusing on getting Chinese and Russian translations, if possible, but if you know another language and would like to contribute, we'll be happy to add it too!

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a static site generator built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) that uses [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) parsed by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to generate documentation pages.

If that sounds complicated - put it simply, documentation files are written in Markdown (or MDX), and are automatically converted into the documentation pages (like this one).

You can read more about Docusaurus Markdown syntax [here](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/).

# FAQ

## Why don't I see any changes in my map?

Check the status bar (blue bar at the bottom of the application) to make sure you've set the correct path to your beatmap.

Also, make sure you've reloaded the map in the editor, as Mapping Tools only edits the .osu files, rather than directly editing the map in the editor (peppy said no). You can reload the map quickly by pressing `Ctrl` `L` in the editor.

## A tool broke my map. What do I do?

Mapping Tools makes a backup of any map that gets edited by it. You can find these backups by going to **Options > Open backup folder**.

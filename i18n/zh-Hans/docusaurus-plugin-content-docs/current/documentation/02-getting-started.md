## Setup {#setup}

Once you've installed Mapping Tools, go to **Options > Preferences** to configure Mapping Tools.

The most important fields to set are the following:

- **osu! folder**: path to the folder containing _osu!_.
- **Songs folder**: path to the folder containing all your maps. It's typically directly inside the _osu!_ folder.
- **osu! config user file**: path to your osu! user configuration file. It's typically directly inside the _osu!_ folder with the filename `osu.[username].cfg`.

:::note

Make sure these fields are correct, as Mapping Tools may not work properly otherwise.
